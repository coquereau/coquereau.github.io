I study ocean and climate variability using ensemble simulations at the **Laboratoire d'OcÃ©anographie Physique et Spatiale** (LOPS, Brest ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·). I'm especially interested in disentangling internal and forced variability and understanding their interactions. This has two main parts:

1. Understanding how the change in background state (i.e., global warming) affects the internal variability of the climate (sometimes described as natural climate oscillations)
2. Understanding how internal variability contributes to the background state (associated with rectification phenomena)

These analyses deploy across different scales and quantities: the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, surface air temperature and precipitation at a global scale, El NiÃ±o-Southern Oscillation, etc.

I'm also interested in methodological questions related to ergodicity, the use of ensemble simulations, and space statistics vs. time statistics, among many others.

This work is currently the object of a PhD thesis under the supervision Florian SÃ©vellec, Thierry Huck, and JoÃ«l Hirschi (NOCS).

Alongside this, I'm also interested in smaller scales, looking at subpolar ocean dynamics, and have been working on this topics using in-situ and remote sensing observations with Nick Foukal at **Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution** (WHOI, MA) ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸.
