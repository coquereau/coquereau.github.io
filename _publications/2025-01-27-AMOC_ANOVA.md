<u>Abstract:</u> The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is a key component of the climate system, exhibiting strong variability across daily to millennial timescales and significantly influencing global climate. Sensitive to external conditions such as freshwater input, greenhouse gas concentrations, and aerosol forcing, important variations of the AMOC can be triggered by anthropogenic emissions. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of sources of AMOC variance in state-of-the-art climate ensemble models. By decomposing the effects of scenario, model, ensemble, and time variability, along with their interactions, through an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), we identify three distinct regimes of AMOC variability from 1850 to 2100. The first regime, spanning most of the historical period, is characterized by a relatively stable AMOC dominated by internal variability. The second regime, initiated by AMOC decline at the end of the 20th century and lasting until mid-21st century, is governed by a transient increase of time variability. Notably, the direct effect of forcing differences remains muted all along this regime, despite the start of emission-scenarios in 2015. The third regime, beginning around 2050, is marked by the emergence and rapid dominance of inter-scenario variability. Throughout the simulations, model variability remains the primary source of uncertainty, influenced by aerosol forcing response, AMOC decline magnitude, and the physical variability. A key finding of this work is the evidence that internal variability decreases simultaneously with AMOC intensity and seems proportional to emission-scenario intensity.
